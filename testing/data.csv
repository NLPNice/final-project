18,"the invention is defined in independent server claim 1, independent method claim 13 and in independent claim 14 related to a computer program product. an object of embodiments of the invention is to reduce the delay in playout when starting a stream or when changing a channel. according to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a server for streaming media content to a client. the media content is encoded as at least one stream, which is divided into consecutive segments. the server comprises a receiver configured to receive a request from the client for a manifest file. the manifest file comprises metadata of the at least one stream. the server further comprises a transmitter configured to send the requested manifest file to the client in response to the request. the transmitter is further configured to push to the client a selected segment of the consecutive segments of the at least one stream in response to the request for the manifest file. the media content may be video, audio andor text. for example, the manifest file may comprise metadata describing the different available quality levels, i.e. the available streams at different bitrates. in a first example, a manifest file provides a template that can be used to obtain the location, e.g. url, of the individual segments of each stream. in a second example, the manifest file includes a list of the locations, e.g. urls, of the segments of each stream. in a third example, a first manifest file lists the locations, e.g. urls, of further manifest files, one for each available bitrate. the further manifest files lists the locations, e.g. urls, of the segments of the stream at the corresponding bitrate or provides a template for obtaining said locations. pushing a selected segment in addition to the requested manifest file has the advantage that a round trip time rtt for requesting the selected by the client and sending the requested segment by the server can be avoided. in other words, the number of rtts of communication between the client and the server is reduced. in conventional methods, only the requested manifest file would be returned in response to a client request for a manifest file. subsequently, the client would request a segment on the basis of the metadata in the manifest file. therefore, conventionally multiple rtts are required to initialize playout of a stream. according to the invention, the number of rtts is reduced and playout can be started earlier. in an embodiment, the server is configured for adaptive streaming of the media content, wherein the media content is encoded as at least two streams encoded at different bitrates. in this embodiment, the manifest file comprises metadata of the at least two streams. the transmitter is configured to push a selected segment of the consecutive segments of a selected one of the at least two streams in response to the request for the manifest file. for adaptive streaming, the quality of the stream, e.g. the video andor audio quality, is adapted according to the available bandwidth and cpu capacity of the client. this corresponds to adapting the bitrate transferred from the server to the client. the media content is encoded as at least two streams, wherein each stream has a different bitrate. each stream is divided into consecutive segments, also called chunks, of typically 2-6 seconds although other durations are also within the scope of the invention. the client can switch between the different bitrates by requesting segments of a stream of appropriate bitrate according to current bandwidth and cpu capacity. freezing due to buffer underrun can thereby often be avoided. pushing a segment in response to request for a manifest file speeds up the initialization of the stream. therefore, the streamed video andor audio may start playing earlier. the selected one of the two streams may be selected by the client. for example, the client may request a manifest file corresponding to a stream having a particular bitrate. in an embodiment the server is configured to select as the selected one of the at least two streams the stream having the lowest bitrate. in an embodiment the server is configured to select as the selected one of the at least two streams the stream having a bitrate previously used by the clients. for example, the server maintains a client state andor session state registering the bitrate used by one or more clients. in an embodiment the server is configured to estimate a bitrate based on network parameters and the server is further configured to select as the selected one of the at least two streams the stream having a bitrate corresponding to the estimated bitrate. preferably, the bitrate is estimated by the server. for example, when a client requests a manifest file, the server estimates the available bandwidth for the clients, selects a stream corresponding to the estimated bitrate and pushes to the client a segment of the stream corresponding to the estimated bitrate in response to the request for the manifest file. in an embodiment the server is configured to communicate with the client according to a web protocol supporting server push. an advantage of using a web protocol is that use can be made of the existing infrastructure of the internet. furthermore, the segments of the stream can be transported through firewalls without problems. in an embodiment, the protocol is an http protocol or a spdy protocol, preferably http 2.0 or later. an advantage of using the http or spdy protocol is that use can be made of the existing http infrastructure of the internet. for example, http-servers, http-proxies and content delivery networks cdns can be reused to deliver has content. furthermore, the segments of the stream can be transported through firewalls without problems. in the context of the invention, the term http also encompasses https, as technically https is http on top of the ssltls protocol. preferably, the server is configured for http adaptive streaming using a http based protocol supporting server push, such as http 2.0 or later, or the spdy protocol. in an embodiment, the server may be configured to establish a persistent connection between the server and the client. for example, the connection may be a tcp connection. in an embodiment, the transmitter is configured to push the selected segment from the server to the client before sending the requested manifest file to the client. clients may not be aware of the fact that the server will push a segment in response to a request for a manifest file. therefore, when the client receives a manifest file from the server, it may unnecessarily send a request for the segment the server is about to push. by pushing the segment with the server before sending the manifest file, requests for the same segment by the client may be avoided. however, in an alternative embodiment, the manifest file may be sent before the segment is pushed. in an embodiment the media content is encoded as at least one video on demand stream vod stream, wherein the server is configured to select as the selected segment the first of the consecutive segments of the corresponding stream. for a video on demand stream, the manifest file will typically include a reference to all segments of the stream, including the first segment of the stream. therefore, in case the client requests a video on demand stream, the server may preferably be configured to push said first segment. in an embodiment the media content is encoded as at least one linear stream, also known as live stream, and the server is configured to select as the selected segment the segment which precedes the most recent segment of the corresponding stream by a predetermined delay. in case of a linear stream, the manifest file is regularly updated by the server, as new segments are added continuously. instead of sending the most recent segment, the server sends a segment preceding the most recent segment by a predetermined delay. this allows the client to fill its buffer for playout of the stream. thereby, buffer underrun can often be prevented, reducing the occurrence of freezing of the playback of the live stream. the segment preceding the most recent segment by a predetermined delay is selected and the selected segment is pushed to the client as a further response to the request for the manifest file of the linear stream. typically the delay is in the order of seconds, e.g. 2-30 seconds. in a further embodiment, the server is configured to set the delay according to a delay previously used by the client. for example, the server maintains a client state andor session state wherein the delay parameters by a client are registered. in an embodiment the transmitter is configured to push the selected segment to the client in response to the request for the manifest file, if   the server is currently streaming different media content to the client than the media content corresponding to the requested manifest file; or the server is currently not streaming media content to the client.  in other words, in this embodiment the selected segment is pushed when initializing the streaming of media content. in particular, a stream is initialized when a client requests media content from the server for the first time or when the client switches between different media content, also known as channel zap. a channel zap may be detected by the server by determining that the client requests a manifest file corresponding to media content different from the media content currently being streamed to the client. the server detects that the client initializes streaming of media content for the first time for the current session between server and client, if the server determines that it is currently not streaming any media content to the client when receiving the request for a manifest file. preferably, the selected segment is pushed only when the server detects that the client performs a channel zap or a first request for streaming media content. it is noted that for a linear stream, the manifest file is regularly updated to incorporate newly created segments of the linear stream. in that case, however, the client is still receiving segments corresponding to the same media content and in one embodiment the server will not push a segment in response to the request by the client for an updated manifest file of the linear stream. in an embodiment the transmitter is further configured to push to the client further data in response to the request for the manifest file, such as drm data. pushing further data in response to the request for the manifest file is advantageous in case further data is needed to initialize the playout of the media content. for example, drm data may be required to initialize playout. in that case the server pushes the selected segment and the drm data to the client in response to the manifest file, as well as responding with the requested manifest file. in an embodiment the server is configured to use different stream priorities to control the delivery sequence of pushed data and pulled data. in this case, pulled data refers to data requested by the client, such as the requested manifest file. further embodiments of the invention relate to a method for streaming media content from a server to a client. the media content is encoded as at least one stream, which is divided into consecutive segments. the method comprises receiving with the server a request from the client for a manifest file. the manifest file comprises metadata of the at least one stream. the method further comprises sending with the server the requested manifest file to the client in response to the request. the method further comprises pushing from the server to the client a selected segment of the consecutive segments of the at least one stream in response to the request for the manifest file. further embodiments of the invention relate to a computer program product comprising non-transitory computer executable instructions configured to, when executed, perform the steps of the method as described above. the same effects and advantages as described above with respect to the server apply to the method and the computer program product.","server  for

41,"it is the object of the invention to create a power supply pertaining to the technical field initially mentioned, that enables to effectively protect the power supply itself as well as the devices connected thereto against surge voltages and thereby to reduce the risk of damage of the power supply or the supplied devices. it is another object of the invention to create an electrically operable device including such a power supply and it is a further object of the invention to provide a corresponding method for protecting a power supply against a surge voltage. the solution of the invention is specified by the features of claim 1. a power supply for feeding a device with electrical power includes a surge voltage protection arrangement for protecting the device against a surge voltage. the power supply is connected to a supply network and converts the input power into an output power that is suited to feed the device. the surge voltage protection arrangement includes a surge protection device that is connected between two current conductors of the power supply, i. e. in parallel to the loaddevice fed by the power supply. according to the invention the voltage protection arrangement further includes a device for determining a comparison voltage, a controllable switch and a switch control where the switch is connected in series with the surge protection device. i. e. the serial connection of the switch and the surge protection device is connected in parallel to the loaddevice. the device for determining a comparison voltage serves for determining a comparison voltage such that the comparison voltage is in some form indicative of a surge voltage present at the input of the power supply. the switch control includes a comparison device for performing a comparison of the comparison voltage with a threshold. further, the switch control is adapted to control a switching of the switch in .dependency of a result of the comparison such that the switch is switched on if the comparison voltage is higher than the threshold. or in other words, no current is flowing through the spd connected between the two current conductors in the normal mode of operation, i. e. when the comparison voltage does not exceed the threshold, because the switch is open. only if the determined comparison voltage is higher than the threshold, the switch is closed and the spd is actually connected between the two current conductors such that a current may flow through the spd. therefore the spd only influences the operation of the device in the case of a surge but does not influence its operation in any way in normal operation mode of the device. this means that the spd may be dimensioned more freely. its voltage value does not have to be chosen 25 higher than the maximal nominal operating voltage of the device but can be chosen in any way to best fulfilling the requirements of the particular application. it can therefore also be chosen to be lower than 125 of the maximal nominal operating voltage without activating the spd where this is not necessary. and the lower the voltage value of the spd, the lower the clamp voltage which more effectively protects the downstream circuit. furthermore, even in the case of a surge, the load can still be operated unlike in the case of the document us 6,118,639 mentioned above. in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the spd is chosen such that the effective clamp voltage is lower than the maximal nominal operating voltage of the device to be protected. or to be a bit more precise: such that the effective clamp voltage is lower than the maximal nominal operating voltage of those parts of the device that are located downstream of the spd. furthermore, the whole circuit may be designed more efficiently because no current is flowing through the spd and therefore less power is wasted during normal operation of the device. depending on the particular application each spd that is connected in parallel to the load may be used to implement the invention. as mentioned above, these include for example a varistor, a suppression diode, a thyristor device, a gas discharge tube, a selenium suppressor or a carbon block suppressor. varistors are preferably used to implement the invention because such varistors, particularly movs are easy to implement, widely available and exist in many different embodiments that allow to best fit them to an application. the device for determining a comparison voltage determines the comparison voltage preferably by sensing the voltage directly across the serial circuit of the spd and the switch, i. e. between the two current conductors between which this serial circuit is connected. this serial circuit of the spd and the switch is also designated as the spd circuit later on. this means that the voltage sensed between those two current conductors is directly used as the comparison voltage. in this way, the determination of the comparison voltage can be implemented very easy and with a very low effort regarding number of elements and costs. however, the comparison voltage may also be derived from the sensed voltage, for example by using a voltage divider or otherwise manipulating the sensed voltage such that the comparison voltage is representative of the sensed voltage. or another voltage that is indicative of a surge voltage and that is sensed between two other conductors of the power supply may be used as the comparison voltage or the comparison voltage may be derived from such a voltage. in another preferred embodiment, the comparison voltage is determined based on the rate of change of the current that flows in one of the current conductors. for this purpose the power supply includes a detection unit that detects the rate of change of the current flowing in at least one of the current conductors. then, the comparison voltage is determined based on the detected rate of change, for example as a voltage proportional to the detected rate of change. preferably, the comparison voltage is determined as being proportional to the detected rate of change, where the proportionality factor for example corresponds to an inductivity present in the respective current conductor. as outlined above, the switch is turned on by the switch control when the comparison voltage exceeds the threshold. this means that the switch remains open as long as the comparison voltage is lower or equal to the threshold. the switch control can however also be built such that the switch is closed if the comparison voltage is equal to the threshold. once the switch has been closed, it has also to be turned off later on. switching the switch off after it has been switched on can be done at different occasions. the switch can for example be switched off by the switch control simply if the surge voltage is finished, i. e. if the comparison voltage is no longer above the threshold. in another example, the switch may be switched off if a predetermined amount of time has lapsed since the switching on of the switch. or the switch may be switched off if a predetermined amount of time has lapsed since the surge voltage is finished, i. e. since the comparison voltage no longer exceeds the threshold. the switch control is therefore preferably adapted to switch the switch off if one or more of these conditions are fulfilled. the invention may be used in any type of power supply, i. e. in dcdc, acdc, dcac or acac power supplies. the invention may for example be employed in a power supply with a dc input. in this case the comparison voltage determined by the voltage detection device is for example the dc voltage between the positive and the negative line at the input of the power supply and the spd circuit may also be connected between the positive and the negative line. since power distribution of medium and low voltage power usually is done with ac grids, the invention is however preferably employed in power supplies with an ac input. in the case of a power supply with an ac input, the comparison voltage preferably is the ac voltage between two phase conductors or between a phase conductor and the neutral conductor of the power supply. the spd circuit then is preferably connected between those two conductors that deliver the comparison voltage. the invention may be employed irrespective of whether the output of the power supply is ac or dc. in a power supply with a dc input, the dc input power may be converted to an ac output or to a dc output with a different voltage. in the case of a dc output, the dc output voltage may be used as the comparison voltage where the spd circuit may either be arranged between the dc output lines or also somewhere between two conductors at the input of the power supply. and in a power supply with an ac input, the ac input power is usually converted to another output power which may be either a dc output or an ac output with a specific amplitude andor phase characteristic. in both cases, the power supply usually includes a rectifier to produce a dc voltage which is then either outputted directly or further converted to another dc output voltage or an ac output voltage. again, the comparison voltage may be an ac or a dc voltage either at the input or at the output of the power supply. and the spd circuit may be connected between two ac or dc conductors either at the input or at the output of the power supply. however, the comparison voltage may also be a voltage tapped from the power supply somewhere between the input and the output of the power supply. and the spd circuit may also be arranged somewhere within the power supply. in a preferred embodiment of the invention, where the power supply is adapted to be fed by an ac grid and therefore includes an ac input, the power supply preferably includes a rectifier. in this case the voltage detection device may determine the comparison voltage either upstream or downstream of the rectifier. i. e. depending on the type and structure of the power supply these two current conductors either are the neutral conductor and a phase conductor or two phase conductors upstream of the rectifier or the two current conductors are the dc output conductors downstream of the rectifier. the rectifier may be any kind or type of rectifier such as for example a controlled or non-controlled rectifier, full or half wave rectifier, centre tapped or bridge rectifier. since many applications, where the invention may be advantageously implemented, include bridge rectifiers, power supplies with bridge rectifiers are preferably used. the spd circuit may also be arranged either upstream or downstream of the rectifier. preferably, it is however connected downstream of the rectifier which allows to select the spd in any desired way. downstream in this connection just means after the rectifier as seen from the grid. in a further preferred embodiment of the invention, a capacitor is connected across the output of the rectifier. this capacitor mainly serves for smoothing the output voltage of the rectifier. when connecting the spd circuit downstream of the rectifier, it is preferably connected directly behind the rectifier, i. e. no other components are arranged between the rectifier and the spd circuit, particularly no other components are arranged serially between the rectifier and the spd circuit. in this case, the leakage inductivity between the spd circuit and the rectifier is very low and the voltage can be clamped even more effectively. as already described above, surge pulses usually have a sharp rising edge. depending on the surge pulse, the power supply and the device to be protected the response time of the voltage detection device, the switch control and the switch may be sufficient to close the switch fast enough to effectively protect the circuits. however, in some cases, the response time of these elements may not be sufficient to close the switch fast enough. in order to avoid that an excessive current flows through the surge protection device at the beginning of a surge pulse the surge voltage protection arrangement preferably includes an inductivity that is arranged in one of the current conductors such that it is connected in series with the surge protection device. this means that the inductivity is arranged such that a surge current from the grid flowing through the surge protection device also flows through the inductivity. this inductivity therefore limits the current at the beginning of the pulse and therefore allows closing the switch in time. the inductivity is for example dimensioned such that the surge current is limited for the first microseconds of the pulse. the inductivity may either be a discrete element such as an inductance, a choke or the like or it may also be a stray or leakage inductivity of an inductive element such as for example a common mode choke that is present in the power supply anyway. the surge voltage protection arrangement may also include an inductivity in each of the two current conductors between which the spd circuit is connected. in this case, the inductivities may be coupled or uncoupled. in case of a power supply with a rectifier, the inductivity may either be connected upstream or downstream of the rectifier. in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the inductivity is connected upstream of the rectifier. any device that is capable of controllably establishing and truncating an electrical connection between two terminals may be used as the controllable switch. depending on the application, the controlled switch may for example be a mechanical switch. however, in many applications such switches have to be fast and reliably wherefore an electrically controllable switch is preferably used. this may for example be a relay but since most applications require a very fast response characteristic, a solid state switch such as a transistor or a thyristor is preferably used. in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the switch includes an igbt insulated-gate bipolar transistor because igbts can switch very fast and combine the highly efficient gate-drive characteristics very low control current of a field effect transistor with the high-current capability and the high block voltage of a bipolar transistor. the emitter of the igbt is connected to a first one of the current conductors and the collector of the igbt is connected to the surge protection device where the other terminal of the surge protection device is connected to a second one of the current conductors. the switch control of course has to be chosen depending on the choice of the switch. accordingly, the switch control may be a manual control. more preferably, the switch control includes an electric or electronic circuit producing an appropriate control or drive signal that is outputted at the control output of the switch control which in turn is connected to the control input of the controllable switch. in the case of an igbt as the switch, the control output of the switch control is connected to the gate of the igbt. the control signal usually is an electrical signal such as a current or voltage signal having specific characteristics in terms of for example amplitude or frequency. voltage signals are usually used as control signals for such switches. depending on the type of control input of the switch, other kinds of signals such may also be used to control the switching of the switch. in the case of an optically controllable switch, the control signal may for example be an optical signal. in a power supply fed by an ac grid, the invention is applicable irrespective of whether the power supply includes just a single phase or multiple phase lines. if however the power supply includes two or more phase lines, an inductivity is preferably arranged in each of the phase conductors of the power supply such that the surge current is limited by at least one of these inductivities no matter through which of the phase lines it flows. of course it would be possible to arrange an inductivity just in one or only a part of the phase lines or for example just in the neutral conductor, this would limit the surge current in those cases where the surge current flows through a conductor that includes an inductivity but it would not limit the surge current in those cases where none of the conductors through which the surge current flows includes an inductor. if for example the power supply is a three phase power supply, an inductivity is preferably arranged in each of the three phase conductors of the power supply. further it is to note that the surge protection arrangement may be provided as a unit separate from the power supply and may be simply connected to the power supply as wished for a particular application. in this way an existing power supply may for example be refitted with such a surge protection arrangement to convert it to a power supply according to the invention. or such a surge protection device may simply be inserted between a power grid and a power supply connected to the grid to achieve surge protection. of course such a surge protection arrangement may also be arranged as a separate unit between the power supply and the load. the solution of the invention regarding the electrically operable device is specified by the features of claim 14. instead of providing a separate power supply and connecting the device to the power supply, a power supply according to the invention is integrated into the electrically operable device such that the electrically operable device includes a power supply as outlined above. usually, the power supply is provided within the housing of the electrical device as a module that may for example be easily removed and inserted into the housing of the device such that it may be easily exchanged in case of a failure of the power supply. however, the circuits and elements of the power supply may also be integrated into a single unit with the circuits and elements of the device, for example on one or more printed circuit boards or the like. in this case, some of the components of the power supply may be part of the electrical device andor vice versa. the solution of the invention regarding the method for protecting the power supply against a surge voltage is specified by the features of claim 15. the method includes the step of connecting a surge protection device between two current conductors of the power supply. according to the invention, the method further includes the steps of connecting a controllable switch in series with the surge protection device, determining a comparison voltage with a voltage detection device, comparing the comparison voltage with a threshold and switching the switch on if the comparison voltage is higher than the threshold. in preferred embodiments of the invention the method may as outlined above include one or more further steps such as for example   chosing the surge protection device such that an effective clamping voltage of the surge protection device is lower than a maximal nominal operating voltage of the device; determining the voltage between the two current conductors as the comparison voltage; switching the switch off if at least one of the conditions a predetermined amount of time has lapsed since switching on of the switch, the comparison voltage is no longer above the threshold and a predetermined amount of time has lapsed since the comparison voltage is no longer above the threshold is fulfilled; in a power supply with a rectifier, connecting the series circuit of the surge protection device and the switch downstream of the rectifier or even directly behind the rectifier; arranging an inductivity in one of the current conductors and in series with the surge protection device, in particular upstream of the rectifier or using an electrically controllable switch, preferably an igbt in series with the surge protection device.  other advantageous embodiments and combinations of features come out from the

54,"when a semiconductor light emitting element is fabricated such that a nitride semiconductor layer is grown on a substrate made of a material different from the nitride semiconductor such as a sapphire substrate, crystal defects misfit dislocations occur at an interface between the substrate and the semiconductor layer due to their lattice mismatch. these crystal defects are formed so as to penetrate the semiconductor layer in the layered direction of the semiconductor layer during crystal growth. each dislocation defect extending in the layered direction of the semiconductor layer is called a threading dislocation. when the threading dislocation reaches the active layer in the semiconductor layer, the threading dislocation functions as non-radiation recombination center and becomes a factor of lowering the luminous efficiency. there is a method for avoiding the reaching of the threading dislocation to the active layer by making a pyramidal recess portion having an apex positioned at the end of the threading dislocation. this recess portion is called a pit having inclined side surfaces surrounding the threading dislocation. when an active layer is grown on the pit after the pit formation, the active layer is layered on the inclined side surface of the pit at a growth rate slower than that on the other portion flat portion. therefore, the thickness of the active layer adjacent to the pit i.e., the threading dislocation becomes thinner, and its quantum energy level increases in comparison with the other portion of the active layer. therefore, carriers are prevented from reaching the threading dislocation, so that lowering of the luminous efficiency can be prevented i.e., pit function. whereas, there is known a way to provide a the electron blocking layer between the p-type semiconductor layer and the active layer in order to prevent electrons coming from the n-type semiconductor layer from passing through the active layer towards the p-type semiconductor layer so-called overflowing of hot electrons. the provided electron blocking layer enables to remain at the active layer electrons going to overflow into the p-type semiconductor layer, so that the provided electron blocking layer contribute to improve the luminous efficiency . here, when the pits exist in the device, the electron blocking layer is formed on the pit. the electron blocking layer is grown on inclined faces facets in the pit which originate in the pit. therefore, a thickness of a portion of the electron blocking layer existing on the pit is smaller than that of the other portion of the electron blocking layer formed on the flat active layer. when the thickness of the electron blocking layer on the pit is small, the electron blocking layer on the pit may not exert its function. namely, the overflowing of electrons into the p-type semiconductor layer can not be prevented. further, electrons may pass through the electron blocking layer and reach the pit i.e., the threading dislocation. decrease of this electron blocking function at the pit portion comes clearly demonstrated as a decrease in luminous efficiency, when driven by a large current or driven at high temperature. the present invention has been made in view of the aforementioned respects . it is an obj ect of the present invention to provide a semiconductor light emitting element of a high luminous efficiency which has an electron blocking layer reliably exerting the electron blocking function in case of having pits, when driven by a large current or driven at high temperature. a semiconductor light emitting element of the present invention is provided as set forth in claim 1. preferred embodiments of the present invention may be gathered from the dependent claims .","a semiconductor light emitting element comprising: a first semiconductor layer  of a first conductivity type;
