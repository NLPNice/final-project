# Data preprocessing

Data from EPO is highly structured. Arguably, being patents in the domain of law documents, descriptions and claims should be fairly consistent in the way they are written.

We performed didn't need to perform heavy preprocessing. Our current pipeline is fully contained in the notebook [Preprocessing.ipynb](./Preprocessing.ipynb). 
Files are hostedn on Google Drive ([out_claim.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lz0CJQ5YmGQWKmcOQtQFr3gzsR_3BYL0/view?usp=sharing), [out_descr.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXXtd_To_5sDBTAa7Hq9pfW1zzO5Cuo7/view?usp=sharing), [out_title.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HcFgE5uSuKSPSjRbBnAPHMcKLbmt48q9/view?usp=sharing)) to avoid the storage of large files on Github.
